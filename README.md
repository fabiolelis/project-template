# Irish Constituencies Neo4j Database
###### Fabio Lelis, G00330441

## Introduction
This project's objective is build a Graph Database using Neo4j and run some queries over that.
The database represents the 2016 General Elections, containing information about the 40 constituencies in the Republic of Ireland, its candidates and parties.

## Database
The first thing necessary to this project was a reliable source that provides all the information about 2016 Elections.
After a few attempts I found it on this [RTE page](http://www.rte.ie/news/election-2016/), with a large amount of well organized data about the Elections, separeted by constutuencies:
